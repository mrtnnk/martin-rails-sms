Example Usage
-------------
	
  * You have to send in the phone number, without any non-numeric characters.  The
    phone numbers must be 10 digits in length.  
  * The two required parameters are the phone number and the phone carrier.
  * Here are the carrier values:
		
    Alltel Wireless   =>  "Alltel"
    AT&T/Cingular     =>  "AT&T"
    Boost Mobile      =>  "Boost"
    Sprint Wireless   =>  "Sprint"
    T-Mobile          =>  "T-Mobile"
    Virgin Mobile     =>  "Virgin"
    Verizon Wireless  =>  "Verizon"
		
    deliver_sms("5558675309","AT&T","your message here")
		
	* You can set the maximum length of the SMS message, which is not set by
    default.  Most phones can only accept 128 characters.  To do this just 
    specify the limit option.
		
    deliver_sms("5558675309","AT&T","your message here", :limit => 128)

	* You can retrieve just the formatted address to use in your own mailer.

  	get_sms_address("5558675309","AT&T")

		This returns "5558675309@txt.att.net"
